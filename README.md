# File Organizer

This Python script helps you organize your files in a directory by sorting them into subdirectories based on their file extensions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- shutil module (usually included in the standard library)

### Installation

No installation is required. Just ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Usage

1. Place the `files_or.py` script in the directory you want to organize.
2. Run the script using a terminal or command prompt.
3. When prompted, enter the path to the directory you wish to organize.

The script will create a new directory named `Sorted` within the specified source directory. It will then move each file into a subdirectory named after its file extension.

For example, all `.jpg` files will be moved to `Sorted/jpg/`, `.txt` files to `Sorted/txt/`, and so on.
